The project architecture is based on clean architecture

In the Api layer, GlobalExceptionHandler is used in .NET 8

I tried to use the repository pattern and unit of work

I haven't written many tests in operational projects so far and it may not be very well structured

Writing the test code becomes a bit more complicated when we use the database, but in this project, because it was not too complicated, I simply used MemoryDb.
